- 👋 Hi, I’m @nintendosbiggestnightmare
- 👀 I’m interested in creating emulators for hardware that's no longer commercially available
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a Nintendo 3DS emulator (Bite me, Nintendo).
- If you ain't selling it, you ain't making money from it. It's fair game.
- 💞️ I’m looking for people to collaborate on my 3DS emulator with me, I've always held the belief that the more = the merrier.
- 📫 You can reach me via Discord, at callmebongos
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been programming since I was a young lad.
